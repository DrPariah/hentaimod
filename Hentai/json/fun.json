    "description": "Collection of (practical when applicable) knowledge about *having fun*.  Higher levels mean you know better moves and are less awkward at it, increasing the enjoyment and the amount of time it takes to finish.  In addition, it also determines your resistance to lust-related attacks.  It may be weird, but using any *fun*-related item will increase this skill, as well of course *having fun* itself."
